# Super-Ankieter
A user friendliness-oriented polling web app that has it all.

# WIP: Don't check this out until I say so please :P

## Goals:
1. Be available in both Polish and English (probably via a CSV)
2. Be a quick polling solution; anyone can make or join polls (if they're allowed to through means such as an invite, or if it's public - go ahead and vote!)
3. Be a randomizing pair solution; such as for secret santa rolls, with both public and private gifter-to-giftee modes
4. Handled via a server, using Node.js and MySQL on the backend
5. Be USER FRIENDLY!!! I don't want to sign up to do stuff, nor search through the UI for what I want. I wonder if I can use Cloudflare...

Interested? Give me suggestions and feedback please!
